# Full Stack Open 2022

Self-studying Fullstack development with https://fullstackopen.com/en/. Part 3 is in a [separate repo](https://github.com/JaakkoHumalajoki/FullStackOpen2022-p3) to make Fly.io deployment easier.

I've tried this course on a previous year but didn't get very far due to time constraints, now I'm doing this again with the plan to get through it all. Redoing the entire thing from the ground up to refresh my memory.
